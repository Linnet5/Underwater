# Procedurally Generated Seabed

A procedurally generated underwater environment made for the course Procedural Methods for Images at Link√∂ping University. The project let me improve my shader knowledge and learn how to create interesting shaders using Unity Shader Graph. It also let me understand how to work with procedurally generated meshes and procedurally placed game objects, both at start- and runtime. The project was created using Unity, Unity Shader Graph and C#.
